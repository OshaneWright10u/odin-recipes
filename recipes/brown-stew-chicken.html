    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Brown stew chicken is a popular Jamaican dish usually eaten on Sundays along with rice and peas. The chicken is seasoned with traditional Jamaican herbs and spices and then “brown”, a term Jamaicans use to describe slightly frying the chicken so that it gains colour on the outside but is soft and juicy on the inside.</p>
        <p>The crisp brown chicken is then simmered in a sauce you made in the same pot you brown the chicken in. The method is the same as cooking brown stew fish.</p>
