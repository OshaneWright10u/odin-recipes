    <h1>Curry Chicken</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The original Jamaican curry chicken recipe is chicken chopped into small pieces, seasoned with Jamaican herbs and spices, and made bright yellow with Jamaican curry powder. There are a few theories about why Jamaicans chopped the chicken into smaller pieces. One theory is that curry chicken can serve more people, especially in large families with limited income. Another theory is that it makes it much easier to eat. For me, it makes eating easier and sure looks better when served.</p>
        <p>But we can forget all the theories because the main thing about Jamaican curry chicken is its taste and flavour. Along with the natural herbs and spices, carrots and ‘Irish‘ potatoes are added, enhancing the flavour and making the golden curry sauce thinker. </p>
